When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I'm working in a team with other developers or
    when I'm working solo but on different computers or
    when I want to publish my source code or
    when I want to have a back up of my project or
    anything that I do not remember right now. ;)


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    One reason might be the following (just as an simple example):
    I'm working on a file. A teammate works on the same file.
    If Git would automaticly update then this may cause a lot of trouble.
    Although this is not the best example, since I and my team may have worked
    sensible and have created branches, automatic updating would distort your
    overview, since it would "mess around" while you may be concentrated
    on completing some task.
