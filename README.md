# reflections
Created for the Udacity course "How to Use Git and GitHub - Learn to use version control, an important tool for any developer.
The course will focus on Git, a specific version control system, and GitHub, a collaboration platform."

For a "deeper" reflection I wrote the file "git-cheat-sheet.txt", which is (you may have guessed it) a cheet sheet. ;)
Here I noted all command lines that were introduced in the curse or which I picked up while doing a little research.
It is however very chaotic and unfortunately completely in German.
The main reason for creating this file was "writing down what I've just done, so it stays in my brain and I'll
(hopefully) never need to read it again."
In other Words: Even if you can read German: Do your own cheat sheet! That's much better! ;)
